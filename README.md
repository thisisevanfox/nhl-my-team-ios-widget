* Shows date and time of next game (local timezone)
* Shows city where the next game takes place
* Show live score of next game. "Live" depends on how often the widget on the homescreen updates itself. It is not possible to say exactly, when it updates.
* Shows stats of both teams (wins, losses, overtime losses)
* Shows top scorer of your team and the opponent (currently of last season, it will update after the first game)
* Shows next 4 games with date
* Caches logos to save data volume.
* Supports light- and dark-mode
* Supports [no-background.js](https://github.com/supermamon/scriptable-no-background)

Note: I don't know how the api displays the games when it comes to playoffs. I'll have to check again when the season is at this point.
