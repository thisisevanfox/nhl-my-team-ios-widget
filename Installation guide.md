# Installation guide

## Step 1:
First, you need to download the Scriptable app from the Appstore:[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?uo=4](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?uo=4)

## Step 2:
Then open the Scriptable app and click on the "+" in the upper right corner. 

## Step 3:
Then copy the complete text from the following link and paste it into Scriptable and click Done.

## Step 4:
In the script you then look for the line "const MY_NHL_TEAM = "ENTER_TEAM_ABBREVIATION_HERE";" and change it with the appropriate abbreviation for your team. Using Toronto as an example, the line would then look like this: const MY_NHL_TEAM = "TOR"; 

## Step 5:
You go to your home screen on your iPhone and "click and hold", then select "Edit Home Screen" and click the "+" in the top right corner. Then you search for Scriptable and select it. 

## Step 6:
Now you have the possibility to set the size of the widget. Currently, only the small and medium size are available. For the medium size you have to swipe to the right once and then select "Add widget". You then land back on the home screen and you see a widget in which "Select script in widget configurator" is then click on this widget, a window opens. If the Scriptable app opens instead, you have to go back to the home screen and "click and hold" on the widget, "Edit home screen" and then click on the widget again. 

## Step 7:
In this window, select the "NHL-MyTeam-Widget" for Script and "Run Script" for When Interacting.
